## Enabling notifications
{: #event-notifications-enable}

Events that are generated by the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} can be forwarded to an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance that is available in the same account. To get started, be sure that you have:

- [**Administrator** platform access](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-access-management) for {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}.
- [**Manager** service access](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-service-access-management) for the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service. To view an existing {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance in your account, you also need **Viewer** platform access or higher.

### Connecting to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} in the console
{: #event-notifications-enable-ui}
{: ui}

Before you can enable notifications for {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}, be sure that you have an [{{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance](/catalog/services/event-notifications){: external} that is in the same account. Then, you can use the **Settings > Event Notifications** section in the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} UI to connect the services.

![The image shows the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} screen in the Security and Compliance Center UI.](../images/event-notifications.svg){: caption="Figure 1. Connecting to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}" caption-side="bottom"}

1. In the console, click the **Menu** icon ![Menu icon](../../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Security and Compliance**.
2. In the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} navigation, click **Settings**.
3. In the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} section, and click **Connect**.
4. In the side panel, review the source details for the connection. Optionally, provide a description.
5. Select the resource group and {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance that you want to connect.

    If an IAM authorization between {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} and {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} doesn't exist in your account, a dialog is displayed. Follow the prompts to grant access between the services.

    1. To grant access between {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} and {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}, click **Authorize**.
    2. In the side panel, select **{{site.data.keyword.en_short}}** as the target service.
    3. From the list of instances, select the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance that you want to authorize.
    4. Select the **Event Source Manager** role.
    5. Click **Review**.
    6. Click **Assign**.

6. To confirm the connection, click **Connect**.

   A success message is displayed to indicate that {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} is now connected to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}. If you need to disconnect from {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} later, you can use the options menu ![options icon](../../icons/actions-icon-vertical.svg) **> Disconnect** to remove the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} as a source service in the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance.

   If you choose to disconnect {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}, do not delete the IAM authorization between {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} and {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}. The {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} uses the existing authorization to unregister from {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}. If an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance is deleted, any authorizations that exist between the service and {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} are also deleted by IAM.

{: tip}

### Email notifications
{: #event-notifications-email}

You can use the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} email service](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-destinations-email) as a delivery channel for {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} event notifications. [Create an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} subscription](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-create-en-subscription) between an existing topic and the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} email service to forward your alerts to various recipients by email.

An email from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} that contains information about a {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} event resembles the following example:

```plaintext
Subject: Validation completed: my-test-validation-scan
Body: The following validation scan was successfully completed in the Security and Compliance Center: my-test-validation-scan. You can view the scan results from the Security and Compliance Center in the console. For more information, check out the docs.
```
{: screen}

Your email displays the [notification payload details](#event-notifications-payload) that are associated with the event.
{: tip}

### Webhooks
{: #event-notifications-webhook}

You can configure a webhook destination so that the properties of an incoming notification can be used programmatically by an app or service. For more information, check out the [{{site.data.keyword.en_short}} documentation](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-destinations-webhook).

## Notification payload details
{: #event-notifications-payload}

Successful events that are generated by a {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} component contain various fields that help you to identify the source and details of an event.

Event notifications from {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} contain only metadata properties, such as names or identifiers of resources. Sensitive data, for example API keys or passwords, are not included in generated events.
{: note}

The metadata properties that are sent to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} vary depending on the event type and subtype. For example, if an `com.ibm.cloud.compliance.posture:posture-scan-completed` event takes place, {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} sends a notification payload to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} that is similar to the following example.

```json
{
    "action": "Validation completed",
    "summary": "my-test-scan",
    "scope": "my-test-scope",
    "profile": "CIS IBM Foundations Benchmark 1.0.0",
