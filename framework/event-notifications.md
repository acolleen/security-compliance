# Enabling event notifications for {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}
{: #event-notifications}

As an administrator of {{site.data.keyword.compliance_full}}, you might want to send notifications of events in {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} to other users, or human destinations, by using email, SMS, or other supported delivery channels. Additionally, you might want to send these notifications of events to other applications to build logic by using event-driven programming using webhooks, for example. This is made possible by the integration between {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} and {{site.data.keyword.en_full}}.
{: shortdesc}

To send information to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}, you must connect {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}. For more information about working with {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}, see [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}](/docs/event-notifications).


## How events are collected and sent by {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}
{: #event-notifications-how}

When an event of interest takes place in the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}, the service communicates with a connected {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance to forward a notification to a [supported destination](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-destination).

{{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} aggregates a list of your pending notifications by [event type](#event-notifications-list). The service checks for and dispatches any pending notifications to the connected {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service as they occur in the system. For example, you might receive notifications that are similar to the following messages:

- A validation scan of your resources was completed.
- A new resource was found in your inventory.
- Control failures exceeded the threshold limit.
- A Security Insights finding was reported for your account.

{: caption="Table 3. List of events that apply to Admin" caption-side="top"}

## Enabling notifications
{: #event-notifications-enable}

Events that are generated by the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} can be forwarded to an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance that is available in the same account. To get started, be sure that you have:

- [**Administrator** platform access](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-access-management#admin-roles) on the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}.
- [**Manager** service access](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-service-access-management) on the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service. To view an existing {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance in your account, you also need **Viewer** platform access or higher.

### Connecting to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} in the console
{: #event-notifications-enable-ui}
{: ui}

Before you can enable notifications for {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}, be sure that you have an [{{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance](/catalog/services/event-notifications){: external} that is in the same account. Then, you can use the **Global settings > Event Notifications** section in the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} UI to connect the services.

![The image shows the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} screen in the Security and Compliance Center UI.](../images/event-notifications.svg){: caption="Figure 1. Connecting to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}" caption-side="bottom"}

{: tip}

### Email notifications
{: #event-notifications-email}

You can use the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} email service](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-destinations-email) as a delivery channel for {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} event notifications. [Create an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} subscription](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-create-en-subscription) between an existing topic and the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} email service to forward your alerts to various recipients by email.

An email from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} that contains information about a {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} event resembles the following example:

```plaintext
Subject: Validation completed: my-test-validation-scan
Body: The following validation scan was successfully completed in the Security and Compliance Center: my-test-validation-scan. You can view the scan results from the Security and Compliance Center in the console. For more information, check out the docs.
```
{: screen}

To receive detailed information about an event notification in your email, select the **Add notification payload** option when you create an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} subscription. Your email displays the [notification payload details](#event-notifications-payload) that are associated with the event.
{: tip}

### Webhooks
{: #event-notifications-webhook}

You can configure a webhook destination so that the properties of an incoming notification can be used programmatically by an app or service. For more information about setting up webhooks, check out the [{{site.data.keyword.en_short}} documentation](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-destinations-webhook).

## Notification payload details
{: #event-notifications-payload}

Successful events that are generated by a {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} component contain various fields that help you to identify the source and details of an event.

{: note}

The metadata properties that are sent to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} vary depending on the event type and subtype. For example, if an `com.ibm.cloud.compliance.posture:posture-scan-completed` event takes place, {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} sends a notification payload to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} that is similar to the following example.

```json
{
    "action": "Validation completed",
    "summary": "my-test-scan",
    "scope": "my-test-scope",
    "profile": "CIS IBM Foundations Benchmark 1.0.0",
