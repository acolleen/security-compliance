# Connecting {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_short}}
{: #setup-workload-protection}

When you integrate an instance of {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_full}} with {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}, you can run scans that validate your level of compliance to a specific predefined profile. Then, you can view all the results and a history of those results in a single location.
{: shortdesc}



In your {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_full_notm}} instance, create a connection that contains the compliance data that you want to see in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} so that you can see both {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_short}} results in one view.

To learn more about how the integration is configured, check out the following diagram.

![The image shows the sequence of events that a user follows as part of setting up the integration.](../images/workload-protection.svg){: caption="Figure 1. {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_short}} integration flow" caption-side="bottom"}

1. Register an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}} bucket to store results.
1. Create an instance of {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_short}} from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog.
1. In your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account, register your {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_short}} integration with the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}.
1. Create an attachment between the scope and the profile. A scope is the set of resources that you want to evaluate, and the profile contains the controls that you want to evaluate.
1. Navigate to the dashboard in the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} UI to view your results.

## Before you begin
{: #wp-before}

Before you get started, be sure that you have the following prerequisites:

* An {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. For more information, see [Setting up your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account](/docs/account?topic=account-account-getting-started).
* An instance of the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} service. For more information, see [Create an instance](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-getting-started#gs-instance).
* A {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} bucket to store results. For more information, see [Setting up data storage and processing for {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-storage).
* The required level of access to create and manage integrations in {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}. To pull results from {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_short}}, you must have the *administrator* platform role or higher for the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} service. For more information, see [Assigning access](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-access-management).



## Creating the {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_short}} instance
{: #wp-instance-create}

Create an instance of {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_full_notm}} that is already configured to run scans. For more information about creating an instance from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog, see [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_short}}](/docs/workload-protection?topic=workload-protection-getting-started).



## Registering the integration
{: #wp-register}

Register an integration with the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}.

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the **Menu** icon ![Menu icon](../../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) > **Security and Compliance** to access the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}.
1. In the navigation, click **Integrations**.
1. In the **{{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_short}}** tile, click **Connect**.
1. Set up service-to-service authorization, which allows {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} to communicate with {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_short}}.
   1. When you are prompted for service authorization, click **Authorize**.
   1. For the target service, select {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_short}}. {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} is set as the source service. Reader access is automatically selected. Click **Review**.
   1. On the Review page, ensure that the target service and role are correct, and then click **Assign**.

   Alternatively, you can use IAM to create an authorization to allow the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} service instance access to the {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_short}} service instance.
   {: note}

1. On the Connect your {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_short}} account page, provide a name for your connection.
1. Select the {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_short}} instance, and then click **Connect**.

After the connection is successfully created, click the **Connected** tab. If you want to open the {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_short}} instance dashboard, click **Dashboard URL**.

## Creating the attachment
{: #wp-attachment}

To evaluate your resources, you create an attachment. An attachment is the association between the set of resources that you want to evaluate and a profile that contains the specific controls that you want to evaluate. An attachment is how you target a specific grouping of your resources to evaluate against a specific profile.

To create an attachment, complete these steps:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} UI, navigate to the **Attachments** page, and click **Create**. A flat list of all of the attachments in your account is displayed.

	Alternatively, you can create an attachment through the **Profiles** page. On the **Attachments** tab of the profile details page, click **Create**, and then continue with the next step.
	{: tip}

1. Provide a name and description for your attachment. Be as descriptive as possible so that it's easy for other members of your team to understand what is being evaluated. Then, click **Next**.
1. Select the **Profile** and **Profile version** that you want to use for your evaluation.

1. Customize the underlying evaluations in your scan by editing the default parameters to match your specific use case.
1. Define a **Scope** to identify the resources that you want to evaluate and the resources that you want to **Exclude**. Then, click **Next**.
1. Select the frequency at which you want to evaluate your attachment. Options include every day, every 7 days, and every 30 days. Additionally, you can pause your scans if you need to.

Profiles are created from libraries. Predefined profiles are available, but you can create a custom profile that uses only the controls that you want. In other words, create a custom profile if you donâ€™t want to use all the controls in the predefined profile.
{: tip}

For more information, see [Running an evaluation](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-scan-resources).

## Viewing the results
{: #wp-results}

Based on the schedule that you defined in your connection, {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_short}} pulls the data in your account to the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}.

To view the results, go to the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} dashboard.

![A visual representation of the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} dashboard. The concepts are fully explained in the surrounding text.](../images/dashboard.svg){: caption="Figure 2. Example dashboard" caption-side="bottom"}

When you visit the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} dashboard, three graphical representations of data are aggregated from your scans. The following data is displayed:

Success rate
:   The rate at which your configurations pass the evaluation that is conducted.

The number of evaluations that are conducted does not always match the number of billable evaluations because no charge occurs for assessments that are evaluated as unable to perform. Be sure to look for the billable evaluations in each scan result if you need to estimate your cost.
{: note}

Total controls
:   The total number of controls that were evaluated in the past 30 days. 

Total evaluations
:   The total number of evaluations that ran in the past 30 days. An evaluation is the check of one resource against one assessment.

For more information, see [Viewing detailed results in the dashboard](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-results&interface=ui#view-detailed-results).
