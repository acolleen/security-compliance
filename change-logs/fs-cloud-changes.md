{: #fs-profile-versioning}

When goals or controls are edited, removed from, or added to a profile in a way that is not compatible with the current version, a new minor version is released. To take advantage of the changes in a new version, update your scans to use the newest profile version. 

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for Financial Services profile is consistently updated and is not an exhaustive list of all the controls that might be required for every organization.

## Version 1.1.0
{: #fs-cloud-v110}

Version 1.1.0 of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for Financial Services profile has been updated to include all 565 controls that have been identified as required to ensure that you are compliant with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for Financial Services reference architecture. As part of that update we've introduced the concept of "Manual assessments". When results are returned, you will see a new status: `user_evaluation_required` - this indicates that the control must be evaluated manually by your organization as the control check is either not yet or cannot be automated.

Additionally, the phrasing of 42 controls was updated for grammar purposes. For example, controls that use the Activity Tracker Event Tracking service were updated to include the correct capitalization.




## Version 1.0.0
{: #fs-cloud-v100}

The format of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for Financial Services profile has been updated with the following changes. Review your configuration closely to ensure that the profile still meets your needs.
- The profile is available only on the **Profiles** page of the **Manage** section of the updated infrastructure.
- The format changed from being goal-based to assessment-based.

Starting with version 1.0.0 of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for Financial Services profile, all new versions of the profile that become available will be compatible only with the updated service architecture. To upgrade your profile version, you must move to the new evaluation format. For more information, see [Getting started](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-getting-started).
