# Change log: {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Security Best Practices
{: #ibm-sec-best-practices-change-log}

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Security Best Practices profile is a collection of controls and goals that meet {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and industry best practices. The profile is consistently updated and can change at any time, which can cause your compliance score to change without any update to your configuration. When new goals or controls are edited or removed from the profile in a way that is not compatible with the current version, a new version is released.


If you're working with this profile, new goals are automatically added to your current scans. If you want more control over when new goals are added, you can create a custom profile that contains all or a subset of the goals that are currently available. For more information, see [Building custom profiles](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-custom-profiles).
