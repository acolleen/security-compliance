## Profile versioning
{: #cl-profile-versioning}

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Best Practices Controls profile is an exhaustive list of all of the controls and goals that are available for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. The profile is consistently updated and can change at any time, which can cause your compliance score to change without any update to your configuration. When new goals or controls are edited or removed from the profile in a way that is not compatible with the current version, a new version is released.


## 27 May 2022
{: #security-compliance-may2722}
{: release-note}

Profiles are constantly expanding and are not an exhaustive list of all of the controls that might be required for every organization. Users can validate the available goals and determine where a need to supplement their workloads with other security and compliance measures exists.
